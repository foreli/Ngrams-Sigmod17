1. Removed comments.txt and added changes.txt (makes usage clearer)
2. Added move constructor and operator= to mstd::vector and trie::trie_node
3. Fixed a possible issue where trie::trie_node::operator= would simply "take" the pointer from the other object 
	(no trie_node object was assigned so far, but could have caused problems in the future)
4. Changed all .h files to .hpp (better understood by cmake)
5. Added mstd::vector::m_push (move_push), which uses std::move to "copy" the object to the vector. 
	In the context of trie_nodes, this means that the _children vector is not copied, but simply moved
6. Newly created nodes are thus not copied to their parent's children vector, but instead moved there.
